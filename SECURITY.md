## Security Measures
This project employs the following security measures:

- **Branch Protection**: Direct pushes to `main` are disabled. All changes must
  go through a Pull Request.
- **Code Review**: All PRs require at least one review.
- **Static Analysis**: We use automated tools to scan for potential security
  issues (e.g., CodeQL, secret scanning).
- **Signed Commits**: We encourage all contributors to sign their commits.

Thank you for helping keep `dev-work-insights` safe!
