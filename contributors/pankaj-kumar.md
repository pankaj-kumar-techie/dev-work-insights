**Secondary Stack:** React, Node.js, TypeScript, FastAPI (for tooling & analytics)  

**Work Style / Preferences:**  
- Remote-first, async communication (Slack/Jira > meetings)
- Prefer focused deep-work blocks (morning heavy coding)
- Agile/Scrum with short standups and clear sprint goals
- Small to mid-sized teams (5–15 engineers)
- Strong ownership: design → implementation → production support
- Linux-based development, VS Code / IntelliJ, Git-first workflow

**Learning / Growth:**  
- **Books**: "Designing Data-Intensive Applications" (Kleppmann), "The Pragmatic Programmer"
- **Hands-on Learning**: Building side tools, improving internal platforms, OSS contributions
- **Cloud & DevOps**: AWS architecture patterns, CI/CD automation, observability
- **AI Usage**: ChatGPT for architecture reviews & refactoring ideas, Copilot for boilerplate
- **Practice**: Regular system-design drills, performance tuning, production incident retrospectives

**Recent / Notable Projects:**  

- **High-Scale Backend Platform** (2023–2025):  
  Designed and maintained Java Spring Boot microservices handling 50k–100k daily users. Built payment, authentication, media, and notification services.  
  Tech: Java 17, Spring Boot, PostgreSQL, Redis, Kafka, Docker, AWS.  
  **Impact**: 2× throughput improvement, 40% latency reduction, 99.95% uptime in production.

- **CI/CD & Deployment Automation**:  
  Implemented Jenkins + GitHub Actions pipelines. Automated build, test, security scans, and deployments. Enabled zero-downtime releases on AWS (EC2, RDS, S3).  
  **Impact**: 60% faster releases, fewer production rollbacks.

- **Event-Driven Microservices Architecture**:  
  Built Kafka-based event pipelines with idempotent consumers. Ensured reliable event ordering and failure recovery.  
  **Impact**: 35% reduction in customer-impacting incidents, improved system resilience under peak load.

- **E-commerce & Analytics Systems**:  
  Developed backend services processing 100k+ daily requests. Implemented Redis caching and SQL optimizations.  
  **Impact**: 30–40% database load reduction, faster API response times (<200ms p95).

**Career Aspirations:**  
Seeking Senior Backend / Platform Engineer roles in product-driven startups or SaaS companies. Interested in:  
- Strong engineering culture (code reviews, testing, observability)
- Remote or hybrid-remote teams
- Systems with real scale and ownership responsibility  
Long-term goal: Move toward Staff Engineer / Technical Lead, influencing architecture, mentoring engineers, and building scalable systems.

**Favorite Tools / Automation:**  
- **Backend**: Spring Boot, Hibernate/JPA, Kafka, Redis
- **Databases**: PostgreSQL (indexing, query tuning), MySQL
- **DevOps**: Docker, Jenkins, GitHub Actions, AWS
- **Observability**: ELK Stack, Prometheus, Grafana
- **Testing**: JUnit, Mockito, Integration testing, Postman
- **Code Quality**: SonarQube, pre-commit hooks, CI quality gates

**Fun / Personality Insight:**  
Mountain-based engineer from Himachal Pradesh. Enjoy trekking, long walks, and building systems that are boring in production (reliable, observable, predictable). Strong believer in “simple architecture scales better than clever code.”
