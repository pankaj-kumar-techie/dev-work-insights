- **Development Environment**: Docker Compose templates for instant local environment setup (DB, Redis, message queues)
- **Productivity**: 
  - Tmux sessions with automated window layouts for different projects
  - Raycast extensions for quick documentation lookup (MDN, DevDocs)
  - Custom Python script to sync GitHub issues with Notion database
  - Alfred workflow for generating UUID, timestamps, and base64 encoding
- **Monitoring**: Custom Grafana dashboards with Prometheus metrics for all services
- **Testing**: Pytest with custom fixtures, Playwright for E2E testing with visual regression
