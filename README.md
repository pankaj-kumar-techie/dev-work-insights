## 🎯 What is This?

A structured repository where developers share **real work insights**:

```mermaid
mindmap
  root((Dev Work<br/>Insights))
    Work Style
      Remote/On-site
      Communication
      Team Size
      Methodology
    Learning
      Books
      Courses
      AI Tools
      Resources
    Projects
      Tech Stack
      Impact

    Career
      Goals
      Preferences
      Industry
    Tools
      Scripts
      Automation
      Workflows
```

### Why It Matters

Traditional profiles don't show:
- ✗ How developers actually work
- ✗ What tools they use daily
- ✗ Their learning approach
- ✗ Real project impact

**This repository fills that gap.**
