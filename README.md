> **A curated collection of developer work insights, projects, and learning habits. Helps founders, recruiters, and developers understand real-world workflows and career aspirations.**

## 📋 What is This?

Dev Work Insights is a structured repository where technical contributors (developers, engineers, data scientists) share:

- **Work styles & preferences** - Remote/on-site, Agile/Scrum, async/sync collaboration
- **Learning habits** - Courses, books, GitHub repos, AI tools, blogs
- **Real projects** - Technical details, impact, and tech stack
- **Career aspirations** - Type of work, team culture, industry preferences
- **Automation & tools** - Scripts, frameworks, productivity workflows

This isn't just another developer directory - it's **actionable intelligence** for:
- 🎯 **Recruiters** - Understand real work styles and technical depth
- 🚀 **Founders** - Find developers who match your team culture
- 👥 **Developers** - Discover peers, tools, and career paths
- 🤖 **AI Analytics** - Structured data for insights and matching

## 🎯 Why This Matters

Generic LinkedIn profiles don't show:
- How developers actually work day-to-day
- What tools and automation they use
- Their learning approach and growth mindset
- Real project impact and technical decisions

This repository fills that gap with **structured, evergreen, actionable insights**.
